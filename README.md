# IBM-Mobile-World-Congress

This was an interactive demonstration for live, touch screen devices at an IBM event. I utilized the Foundation framework for a base grid and components. I used Gulp as a task runner and Sass for my styles. This is a fully-responsive, immersive demonstration that has been expanded to become an iPad app for internal use at IBM.
